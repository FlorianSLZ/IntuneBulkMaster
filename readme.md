# IntuneBulkMaster 
The `IntuneBulkMaster` provides a set of functions for managing and interacting with Microsoft Intune. It is designed to perform bulk operations on Intune-managed devices, such as rebooting, collecting diagnostics, and rotating keys. This module facilitates efficient management of devices by allowing administrators to perform tasks across multiple devices or groups with ease.

## PowerShell Module
You can find the PowerSHell module and readme in the subdirectory [Module\IntuneBulkMaster](https://github.com/FlorianSLZ/IntuneBulkMaster/tree/main/Module/IntuneBulkMaster).

## UI
The UI will be developed once the PowerSHell module is well tested and considered stable.
